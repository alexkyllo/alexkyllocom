While my last post explained why the ability to read and write programming code is becoming the new literacy and shared some of my personal struggles in obtaining it, this post will focus on the political implications of this change, with some historical context.

Today I stumbled on [this article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/business/2013/02/socialist-memes-at-ted/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Top+Stories%29), a mainstream tech magazine, which expressed shock at the left-leaning political content of 2013 TED talks delivered by several prominent sofware developers and computer scientists.

Now, forget the current conservative vs. liberal quarrels of American politics today, and think about the environment that socialism and Marxist thought came from. From the late 1800's through the Second World War was a period of rapid industrialization and mass transition away from agriculture and hand crafts as the primary means of employment. Most of the manual, hard labor that used to be done in the fields by humans, became automated through the invention of farm equipment. At the same time, much of the craftsman labor was also automated as machines replaced traditional wood and metalworking.

While these innovations were responsible for massive efficiency gains and dramatically reduced goods prices, they also obsoleted millions of jobs and concentrated the lion's share of these wealth gains into the hands of the early capitalists who invested in such technology. 

While this economic shift caused mass unemployment for those whose jobs were automated away, this was temporary because human labor was still a primary input in the industrial process. Factories and mills became the normal workplace for most. 

The problem with this system was that humans were treated as industrial inputs and in order to maximize profit, factory owners ground them to dust with long hours, dangerous conditions, and low wages. Public opinion bristled at the unfairness of this arrangement, and so the Marxist worldview became very popular for a while. The idea that exploited factory workers could band together and sieze control of the means of production, so that everyone could enjoy a fairer slice of in the wealth it produced, was a powerful and appealing one at the time. It was only after WWII, when we saw the Soviet Union's experiment begin to falter and devolve into corruption under the dictatorship of Stalin, that this ideology fell completely out of favor in the West. But it left behind a powerful legacy of collective bargaining and protective regulations, through which unionized labor, government bureaus, and NGOs were able to strike a bargain with industrial employers to give us things like weekends, overtime pay, vacation and sick days, healthcare, and safer working conditions. This allowed workers to earn enough to own their residences and enjoy leisure time, and thus the middle class was born.

But in the 1980s under Reagan, we began to question this bargain. Politically we were focused on winning the Cold War, as we were appalled by the oppression that took place in the USSR. We saw freedom as the opposite of Communism, and we feared giving the government too much power, lest it over-tax us and spend our hard-earned money on social programs for other, *lazier* people. (This fear also stemmed from racism, but that is another topic.) So we wondered whether the social contract was worth it, and if it wasn't possible instead for all of us to be little capitalists and enjoy great freedom and independence as households with minimal government involvement. The 1980s and 90s saw a corresponding growth in small businesses, entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, partly aided by technological gains (fax machines, personal computers, the internet) and financial innovations (greater access to business loans and equity sales to speculative investors) that made it much cheaper and faster to start and grow a business. And naturally, if you feel that you started something from scratch and built it yourself, you want the government sticking its hands in it as little as possible.

But today, as software obsoletes away more and more white-collar jobs, and companies make more profits with less headcount, we are starting to realize that "software is eating the world." So it appears the pendulum is again starting to swing the other way, as evidenced by the recent resurgence of socialist thought among the tech community, and the gradual leftward shift in American national politics. 

Software developers are realizing this first, because they know that if the only job that software cannot (yet?) automate away is the job of creating software itself, then the work of developing, deploying, and supporting business software will increasingly be the only type of labor readily available in the market. Software developers will become the factory workers of the digital age.

The industrial revolution was temporarily bad for working folk, but became quite good once workers used their numbers to assert their bargaining power, because they were still needed. But what will happen when we reach the point where a multinational, multimillion-dollar corporation no longer needs more than a handful of humans to run it? 

Will we simply accept that we are unnecessary, because our labor was merely an overhead cost that corporate board members are happy to do away with so that they can enjoy greater profits? And we're left to fend for ourselves with no salaries or benefits? And do we just watch while a small, but powerful owner class becomes exponentially wealthier and devolves into an old-school aristocracy as they raise generations of children who never have to work? How long can our democracy even last under such a situation?

Or will it be time that we strike a new social bargain--one in which we recognize that we as a society have created enough wealth to go around, and that if we share it a little more evenly, we can finally afford to upgrade our definition of human rights to include nourishment, shelter, and basic medical care?
