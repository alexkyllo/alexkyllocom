Hi, I'm Alex. I work as a data scientist for Microsoft Azure, where I analyze
telemetry and run experiments to discover and test methods of improving
the developer user experience.

Prior to this, I worked as a business data analyst, sales & marketing analyst,
and IT systems analyst at a couple of different logistics companies.

I'm currently a student in the
[Graduate Certificate in Software Design and Development](https://www.uwb.edu/stem/graduate/gcsdd)
program at the University of Washington Bothell.
Prior to this, I was a self-taught programmer, so I'm doing this to
fill in gaps in my knowledge of computer science fundamentals, and to get
exposure to the basics of low-level systems programming in C/C++.

In the realm of data science, reproducibility is one of the areas I'm most
passionate about. When putting together an analysis for a paper or presentation,
it's tempting to do things in a manual fashion, but scripting your process goes
a long way toward building credibility. I want to make that easier for myself
and others.

I've contributed Python web programming and cloud DevOps support to
[Curate Science](https://curatescience.org/), a non-profit site for encouraging
transparency and reproducibility in academic research publications.

I majored in Chinese Language and Literature and spent my sophomore year of
university in Chengdu, Sichuan. I still read and speak Mandarin every day.
I'm fascinated by Chinese history, it's one of my favorite conversation topics.

I want to someday make a significant contribution to the field of computing,
perhaps by starting a new programming language, framework, database, or
combination of these, that makes data analysis much faster and easier.
I'll use my blog to document what I learn as I go along.
