I just wrapped up the first quarter of my master's degree program.  My
Machine Learning class was project-driven and the project I chose to
work on was fake face detection. I picked this topic mostly because I
had no experience with computer vision or image ML and wanted to try
something new to me, plus I knew that there was an obvious ethics
component to facial recognition AI and wanted to feature that in my
work.
